> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The terminal is kitty terminal , so install kitty terminal before hand to use ST terminal you need to change config.h of dwm 
> - install picom beforehand as well since it's added to be executed on .xinitrc or if you are gonna use other compositor replace picom to that compositor name in .xinitrc
> - do not copy .zshrc just install that ohmyzsh from scratch


> [!NOTE]
> - slstatus is fine as it is , st is fine as well ( dont bother installing st if using virtual machine just install kitty ) 
> - install xwallpaper as well 
> - install python-wal for auto color scheme
