> [!IMPORTANT]
> - install 'figlet' [for big text on terminal] 
> - install 'python-pywal' [for auto colors scheme on terminal] 
> - install 'kitty' [Bcs it is set in dwm config.h file] 
> - install 'zsh' [Bcs you will be using .zshrc config for python-pywal and figlet]  
> - The terminal is kitty terminal , so install kitty terminal before hand cause to use ST terminal you need to change config.h of dwm and find kitty word replace it with st  
> - install picom beforehand as well since it's added to be executed on .xinitrc or if you are gonna use other compositor replace picom to that compositor name in .xinitrc
> - do not copy .zshrc just install that ohmyzsh from scratch what you should copy is two commands on top starts 'wal' and 'figlet'


> [!NOTE]
> - slstatus is fine as it is , st is fine as well ( dont bother installing st if using virtual machine just install kitty )
