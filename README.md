[!IMPORTANT]
> The terminal is kitty terminal , so install kitty terminal before hand to use ST terminal you need to change config.h of dwm 
> install picoom beforehand as well since it's added to be executed on .xinitrc
> do not copy .zshrc just install that ohmyzsh from scratch
[!NOTE]
> slstatus is fine as it is , st is fine as well ( dont bother installing st if using virtual machine just install kitty ) 
> install xwallpaper as well 
> install python-wal for auto color scheme
